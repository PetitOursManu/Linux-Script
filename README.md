# AD-join-ui-script 
Script in French only.
Little script to join or unjoin an Active Directory Domain with a RHEL/Debian based distro with a Graphical User Interface. GUI is made with Zenity. Make sure to have all informations to join your domain and to fill the UI input script. Go to the ZBear folder and do "sudo ./ZBear.sh". Before launching, make sure you have the execution right on ZBear.sh ("chmod +x ZBear.sh" to allow executable permissions).
Enjoy!
